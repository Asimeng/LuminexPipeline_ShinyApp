# LuminexPipeline_shinyApp

<p> This utility is an interactive application for the explorartory data analysis of multiplexed ELISA (Luminex) data, developed as part of my MSc dissertation. The current version of the ShinyApp can be assessed <a href="https://asimeng.shinyapps.io/luminex_app/">with this link</a> and has the following functionalities: 
<ul>
  <li> Upload processed Luminex data (data output of pipeline) for exploratory analysis (accepts .rds file format) </li>
  <li> Explore statistical summaries with: 
    <li> Correlation (Pearson and Spearman) between analytes </li>
    <li> Effects of Box-Cox,  log transformation, and no transformation on analyte concentrations </li>
    <li> Visualisation of box plot, q-q plot and histograms of analytes </li>  
   </li>
</ul>
For testing purposes, there is an already uploaded test data (overided upon upload of real data) for exploring the functionality of the app.
